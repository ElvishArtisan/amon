HIGH-LEVEL DATA FORMAT
----------------------
Each data message has the following high-level format:

<AA> <payload-len> <verb> <data> [..] <check-sum>

where:

<AA> - The 0xAA byte (ASCII 'x').

<payload-len> - Count of number of bytes comprising the <verb> + <data> bytes.

<verb> - A single-byte value indicating the type of message.

<data> - Zero or more bytes of type-specific data.

<check-sum> - A single-byte check sum consisting of the eight least
              significant bits of the sum of <verb> and <data> bytes.


MESSAGE TYPES
-------------

<01> - Stereo Channel Data

Contains a full set of level data for a stereo audio channel.  Structured as
follows:

<01> <status> <left-lvl> <right-lvl> <sum-lvel> <diff-lvl>

where:

       <01> - The 0x01 byte (ASCII SOH)

  <channel> - Channel number, single byte

 <left-lvl> - The audio level of the left channel, sent as a thirty-two bit
              signed integer in network byte order.

<right-lvl> - The audio level of the right channel, sent as a thirty-two bit
              signed integer in network byte order.

  <sum-lvl> - The audio level of the sum of the left and right channels, sent
              as a thirty-two bit signed integer in network byte order.

 <diff-lvl> - The audio level of the difference of the left and right 
              channels, sent as a thirty-two bit signed integer in network 
              byte order.

   <status> - Single byte of status and alarm data, structured as followed:
		 Bit 0: low level alarm
		 Bit 1: high level alarm
		 Bit 2: high L-R alarm

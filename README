This is the README file for the AMon package.

AMon is a system for monitoring and display audio levels.  It consists of two
parts:  the amond(8) audio monitoring daemon, which is normally configured to
start automatically at the time of system startup, and the amon(1) display
application, which provides a customizable, GUI-based display of level
parameters.  Amon(1) can display level data from amond(8) instance located
either on the local machine, or on remote machines by means of TCP/IP
networked connections.

Instructions for building, installing and configuring AMon can be found in the
'INSTALL' file.

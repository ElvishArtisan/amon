This is the installation file for the AMon package.

PREREQUISITES
In order to build AMon, you will need the following

Qt ToolKit, v3.2.x or later

ALSA, v1.0.0 or later


BUILDING THE SOFTWARE
After unpacking the tar archive and cd'ing to the top directory, simply do:

./configure
make
make install

(The 'make install' step must be done as root).


CONFIGURATION
Two configuration files are necessary for the proper operation of AMon,
samples of which can be found in the top directory of the source tree.  The
'alsa.conf-sample' file shows the format of entries required to get one or
more sound cards to be recognized by amond(8).  These entries should go in the
'.asoundrc' file of the account that runs the daemon (normally 'root').  The
'amon.conf-sample' file should be copied to '/etc/amon.conf'.  This file
describes the layout of meters and other screen widgets used by the amon(1)
display program.


STARTUP
Once configured, the amond(8) daemon can be started by doing (as root):

     /etc/init.d/amond start

The amon(1) screen display program can be started simply by doing:

    amon
